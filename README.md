## Algorithms and Theoretical Computer Science

- **On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem** (1937), Turing, A. M. [[pdf]](https://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/images/Turing.pdf)

  This article set the limits of computer science. It defined the [Turing Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Machine), a model for all computations. On the other hand, it proved the undecidability of the [halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem) and [Entscheidungsproblem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entscheidungsproblem) and by doing so found the limits of possible computation.





## Artificial Intelligence

- **Deep learning** (2015), LeCun, Y., Bengio, Y., & Hinton, G. [[pdf]](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/NatureDeepReview.pdf)





## Computer Architecture

- The case for the reduced instruction set computer (1980), Patterson, D. A., & Ditzel, D. R. [[pdf]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/641914.641917?casa_token=bZ7Kk3fVGPEAAAAA:Utia09O0bc9gCLox-U2CXTwUXc614cqK3G542mHGn-G2wqbSQiFPPtgFVczBdlIEhQMp3yPQbRiiaQ)

  This article introduced [*reduced instruction set computer* (*RISC*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer) CPU design philosophy. RISC is a CPU design philosophy that favors a reduced, highly optimized set of simpler instructions, in contrast to [complex instruction set computer (CISC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer).
