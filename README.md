## Algorithms and Theoretical Computer Science

- **On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem** (1937), Turing, A. M. [[pdf]](https://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/images/Turing.pdf)

  This article sets the limits of computer science. It defined the [Turing Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Machine), a model for all computations. On the other hand, it proved the undecidability of the [halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem) and [Entscheidungsproblem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entscheidungsproblem) and by doing so found the limits of possible computation.





## Artificial Intelligence

- **Deep learning** (2015), LeCun, Y., Bengio, Y., & Hinton, G. [[pdf]](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/NatureDeepReview.pdf)





## Computer Architecture

- **The case for the reduced instruction set computer** (1980), Patterson, D. A., & Ditzel, D. R. [[pdf]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/641914.641917?casa_token=bZ7Kk3fVGPEAAAAA:Utia09O0bc9gCLox-U2CXTwUXc614cqK3G542mHGn-G2wqbSQiFPPtgFVczBdlIEhQMp3yPQbRiiaQ)

  This article introduced [*reduced instruction set computer* (*RISC*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer) CPU design philosophy. RISC is a CPU design philosophy that favors a reduced, highly optimized set of simpler instructions, in contrast to [complex instruction set computer (CISC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer).





## Computer Graphics

- **Sketchpad a man-machine graphical communication system** (1964), Sutherland, I. E. [[pdf]](http://images.designworldonline.com.s3.amazonaws.com/CADhistory/Sketchpad_A_Man-Machine_Graphical_Communication_System_Jan63.pdf)

  One of the founding works on computer graphics.





## Computer Networks

- **A protocol for packet network intercommunication** (1974), Cerf, V., & Kahn, R. [[pdf]](http://education.sigcomm.org/papers/ck74.pdf)

  This paper contains a lot of the ideas that later became TCP and IP, two foundational protocols that make up the Internet. Cerf and Kahn received the ACM Turning Award, in part for the work contained in this paper.
