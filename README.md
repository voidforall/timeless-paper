## Algorithms and Theoretical Computer Science

- **On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem** (1937), Turing, A. M. [[pdf]](https://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/images/Turing.pdf)

  This article sets the limits of computer science. It defined the [Turing Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Machine), a model for all computations. On the other hand, it proved the undecidability of the [halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem) and [Entscheidungsproblem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entscheidungsproblem) and by doing so found the limits of possible computation.



## Artificial Intelligence

- **Deep learning** (2015), LeCun, Y., Bengio, Y., & Hinton, G. [[pdf]](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/NatureDeepReview.pdf)



## Computer Architecture

- **The case for the reduced instruction set computer** (1980), Patterson, D. A., & Ditzel, D. R. [[pdf]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/641914.641917?casa_token=bZ7Kk3fVGPEAAAAA:Utia09O0bc9gCLox-U2CXTwUXc614cqK3G542mHGn-G2wqbSQiFPPtgFVczBdlIEhQMp3yPQbRiiaQ)

  This article introduced [*reduced instruction set computer* (*RISC*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer) CPU design philosophy. RISC is a CPU design philosophy that favors a reduced, highly optimized set of simpler instructions, in contrast to [complex instruction set computer (CISC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer).



## Computer Graphics

- **Sketchpad a man-machine graphical communication system** (1964), Sutherland, I. E. [[pdf]](http://images.designworldonline.com.s3.amazonaws.com/CADhistory/Sketchpad_A_Man-Machine_Graphical_Communication_System_Jan63.pdf)

  One of the founding works on computer graphics.



## Computer Networks

- **A protocol for packet network intercommunication** (1974), Cerf, V., & Kahn, R. [[pdf]](http://education.sigcomm.org/papers/ck74.pdf)

  This paper contains a lot of the ideas that later became TCP and IP, two foundational protocols that make up the Internet. Cerf and Kahn received the ACM Turning Award, in part for the work contained in this paper.



## Computer Security

- **New directions in cryptography** (1976), Diffie, W., & Hellman, M. [[pdf]](https://ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf)

  Diffie and Hellman proposed the scheme of ["Diffie-Hellman key exchange"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange), with the idea of private key and public key. It set up the basis for the following authenticated [key-agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key-agreement_protocol) protocols.

## Databases

- **A relational model for large shared data banks** (1970), Codd, E. F. [[pdf]](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~zives/03f/cis550/codd.pdf)

  Codd introduced the [relational model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model) for database management to manage data using a structure and [relational algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra). It motivates [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) and integrates into all relational database management systems ([RDBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database#RDBMS)).

## Operating Systems

- **The UNIX time-sharing system** (1974), Ritchie, D. M., & Thompson, K. [[pdf]](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/cs262/unix.pdf)

  The [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) and its principles were described in this paper. The main importance is not of the paper but of the operating system, which had tremendous effect on operating system and computer technology.

## Programming Languages

- **The FORTRAN Automatic Coding System** (1957), Backus, J. W. et al. [[pdf]](http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Fortran/102663113.05.01.acc.pdf)

  This paper describes the design and implementation of the first [FORTRAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FORTRAN) compiler by the [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM) team. Fortran is a [general-purpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_programming_language), [procedural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming), [imperative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) language that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing.

## Software Engineering

- **Software engineering: Report of a conference sponsored by the NATO science committee, Garimisch, Germany** (1968), Naur, P., & Randell, B.  [[pdf]](http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/brian.randell/NATO/nato1968.PDF)

  Conference of leading people in software field in 1968.
  This paper defined the field of [Software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering)
